# Agent Specifications

The Company Research Agent uses three specialized AI agents, each with a specific role in the research process. This document details each agent's configuration and responsibilities.

## Researcher Agent

The primary data gathering agent.

```python
@agent
def researcher(self) -> Agent:
    """
    @agent Company Research Specialist
    @description Expert in gathering comprehensive company information
