## Common Implementation Pattern

All tools follow a similar implementation pattern:

1. **Synchronous Wrapper**
```python
def _run(self, input_param: str) -> Dict:
    """Execute synchronously by creating a new event loop"""
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    try:
        return loop.run_until_complete(self._async_run(input_param))
    finally:
        loop.close()
```

2. **Async Implementation**
```python
async def _async_run(self, input_param: str) -> Dict:
    """Async implementation of the tool"""
    # Tool-specific implementation
```

## Error Handling

Tools implement comprehensive error handling:

```python
try:
    actor_run = await self.actor.call(actor_id="actor_id", run_input=run_input)
    if actor_run is None:
        raise RuntimeError('Actor task failed to start.')
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error in tool execution: {str(e)}")
    raise
```

<Note>
All tools are designed to be thread-safe and can be used concurrently by multiple agents. They handle their own error cases and resource cleanup.
