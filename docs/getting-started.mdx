This guide will help you start using the Company Research & Analysis Agent to gather comprehensive company information using AI agents.

## Prerequisites

- An [Apify account](https://console.apify.com/sign-up)
- API token from your Apify account (if using programmatically)
- Google API key for the Gemini model
- Python 3.8 or later

## Installation

### 1. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install apify-client crewai python-dotenv nest-asyncio
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
APIFY_TOKEN=your_apify_token
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

## Quick Start

### Using the Web Interface

1. Visit the [actor page](https://apify.com/pratikdani/company-research-analysis-agent)
2. Click "Try for Free" or "Use with Custom Data"
3. Enter a company domain (e.g., `apple.com`)
4. Click "Start"
5. Wait for the AI agents to complete their research

### Using Python

```python
from apify_client import ApifyClient
from src.company_research_crew import CompanyResearchCrew

# Initialize the Apify client
client = ApifyClient('YOUR_API_TOKEN')

# Initialize the research crew
research_crew = CompanyResearchCrew(actor=actor)

# Start the research process
result = research_crew.crew().kickoff(
    inputs={'domain': 'apple.com'}
)
